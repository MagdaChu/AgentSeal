to should-I-rest

;; resting model 1 and 2 only differ in terms of how much fish a seal gets at each dive

  ; ###################################

  ; there are three mechanisms triggering resting, but at the moment we use first two:
  ;1: eating more than 80-100% of stomach volume (we assume 1l of stomach = 1 kg of fish) and then resting 45-60 min, mimicing large-scale resting from Ramasco 2014

  if fishConsumed_g >= (random (stomachCap - (0.8 * stomachCap)) + (0.8 * stomachCap))

    ;show (word "resting > stomach " durationOfResting)
    ;show "only fishConsumed reset"
 ]

  ;2: food consumption since last large resting is more than 7-14% of seal's body weight (large-scale rest) - (Renouf 1991)
  ; the length of resting is proportional to how much they ate (sparling 2007, manual quick and dirty regression from Fig 2b)
  ; if they have to rest more than minimum time observed haul-out (which is 10 min based on analysis of
  ; East coast seals so less than one time step but leave it if it changes in the future),, they go to houl out if within certain distance to a haul-out, otheriwse they stay and rest at sea
  ; if the haul-out, they may have the time spend at haul-out increased in compariosn to time they would otherwise spent resting at sea
  ; this is following the idea that seals would haul-out for additional reason than just digestion
  ; but the time to haul-out cannot be shorter than time otherwise spent resting at sea

  ;let MaxPercBodyWeight (random-float (14 - 7) + 7) ; seals can consume max 7-14% of their body weight daily (Renouf 1991, Rosen 2004, Ryan pers comm) after this they have to rest (long rest)

to should-I-haul-out ; in previous model versions there was an older procedure called should-I-haul-out, this is a new version but even if the old one is deleted from this code I keep the name

;Seals haul-out either to digest or to maintain their skin. Whether seals digest at the
;haul-out site (prob_HO_DIGESTION_NEED, need2ho_DIGESTION_NEED) or at sea depends on the distance
;between place where the seal is at the moment it has to digest
;and its next houl-out (calc-attraction-of-hauls defines what is the next haul-out).
;The distance / probability of haul-out relationship is defined by exponential function
; digestion related haul-out always take place regarding skin and blubber condition of seals

; the probability of hauling out increase with time since last haul-out meaning that the longer the seals are at sea, the worse the condition of their skin is
; however, if seals are in bad condition (low blubber %), they are more likely to remain foraging regardless their skin condition (idea taken from fur seal IBM)
